    And "Student 1" row "Status" column of "student_questions" table should contain "Needs grading"
    And I should see "Multi-choice-001"
    And I set the field "Question grade" to "80 / 100"
    And I set the field "Grade comment" to "Feedback from teacher."
    And I press "Save all grades & feedback"
    Then I should see "Feedback from teacher."
